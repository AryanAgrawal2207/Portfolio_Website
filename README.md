## Introduction
Built entirely using the React.js framework, this project is meant to be a showcase of my personal skills, education, projects and act as a means for employers to contact me. Basically a fancy resume. This project was a lot of fun to build and I learned a ton of things about React, as it was largely my first big project using React.
